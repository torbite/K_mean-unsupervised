# k_mean-unsupervised
This is a recreational project, that was made just for my personal enjoyment and learning.
The code creates 1000 random points with positions that vary from [1,1] to [1500,1500] and then utilizes the k_mean algorithm and find clusters (minimum 1, maximum 18) within the points. After that, it shows the results in a graph.
The K_mean algorithm works by creating a "k" amount of clusters, and adjusts their centers until they reach a confortable position.
For the learning of the algorithm, no machine learning libraries, such as tensorFlow, were used. The only libraries utilized were the following: matplotlib, random and copy 

To test the project you need to have the two files in the same folder ("cartesianCalc.py" and "k_mean_manually.py"), and then run "k_mean_manually.py". The code will ask you for a amount of clusters from 1 to 18, and then will show the results. After you are done, you can simply close the graph window.
